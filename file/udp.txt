udp_mem (since Linux 2.6.25)
This is a vector of three integers governing the number of pages allowed for queueing by all UDP sockets.

min       Below  this number of pages, UDP is not bothered about its memory appetite.  When the amount of memory allocated by
UDP exceeds this number, UDP starts to moderate memory usage.

pressure  This value was introduced to follow the format of tcp_mem (see tcp(7)).

max       Number of pages allowed for queueing by all UDP sockets.

Defaults values for these three items are calculated at boot time from the amount of available memory.

===============================================================================
1. 修改SO_SNDBUF
	int buf_size = 10 * 1024;
	int send_buf_size = buf_size * 2 + 1024 * 32;
	setsockopt(msocket, SOL_SOCKET, SO_SNDBUF, (char*)&send_buf_size, sizeof(send_buf_size));
2. 修改wmem_max
	cat /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max
	vi /etc/sysctl.conf
		wmem_max=MAX
	sysctl -a | grep wmen_max
